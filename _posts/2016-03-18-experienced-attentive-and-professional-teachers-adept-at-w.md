Experienced, attentive, and professional teachers adept at working with anyone--youngster through adult--at any skill level. 

**We love music and people! **We come from one musically devoted family and we are blessed with talent we want to share, and are dedicated instructors and musicians who combine a love of music with a desire to help others who want to achieve their highest musical potential. That passion shows in what we do! Every lesson is custom made to each student presented with music theory, interactive rewards, music analyzation, and history segments. 

**Our Mission:** It's all about you, always.
Simply put, our mission is devoted to you--making the most of your musical talent and helping you achieve your goals. Everyone learns differently, and their own style and pace is best, which is what we have discovered to work to your advantage.
We love to discuss what musical training you've already had and your goals--whether they're to turn pro or just enjoy music for the rest of your life. 

**The Highest Integrity:**
Despite our casual setting of learning, as should all things that come naturally, we hold ourselves to a standard that's higher than anyone else. Put us to the test, and you'll see. 

**Current Private Lessons Offered:** Piano, Violin, Voice
